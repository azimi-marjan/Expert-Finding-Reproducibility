# ðŸ§  Expert Finding Models

This directory contains implementations of the four expert finding models evaluated in our paper:

---

## ðŸ“˜ CB (Concatenated-Profile Based Model)

In this model, we concatenate all documents written by an author into a single profile.  
We then index and rank these profile documents using [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini).

---

## ðŸ“˜ DB (Document-Based Model)

To run this model:

1. Use Pyserini to generate a language model based on the dataset and query set.
2. Use the resulting document-query scores as input to the `DB_model`, which ranks authors based on document-level evidence.

---

## ðŸ“˜ DSEF (Document-Score + Network-Based Model)

This model extends the DB approach by incorporating network information:

1. Generate document-query language model scores using Pyserini (same as in DB).
2. Calculate degree centrality for each author based on the citation network.
3. Run `DSEF_model.py` to combine both evidence types (document scores + network centrality) for expert ranking.

## ðŸ“˜ ExpFinder

We use the official implementation of **ExpFinder** provided by Kang et al. (2023).  
The code is available at the following link:
